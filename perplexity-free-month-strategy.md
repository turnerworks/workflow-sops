# SOP: Executing the Perplexity Free Month Strategy

## Mission
Demonstrate Comet browser + Perplexity's value through a public case study that convinces them to grant 30-day Pro access.

## The Core Strategy
**Frame this as:** "Mini case study + experiment" — NOT a job application or sponsorship request.

**Value exchange:** 30 days Pro/Comet access → Public documented case study showing how a solo automation developer uses their ecosystem as a workflow engine.

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Preparation

### 1.1 Define Your Workflow Demonstration
**Goal:** Show AI self-bulking — using AI to plan workflows that AI then executes through your systems.

**Key workflows to document:**
- [ ] Multi-platform automation (GitHub + Gmail + Jira + Telegram)
- [ ] AI-driven planning sequences (Comet generates plan → follows plan → executes through systems)
- [ ] Documentation automation (screenshots + examples + article generation)
- [ ] CRM/project management integration workflows
- [ ] Code generation and review workflows

### 1.2 Gather Existing Proof
Collect evidence of your current AI automation work:
- [ ] Screenshots of existing workflow executions
- [ ] Examples of AI-generated plans and their results
- [ ] GitHub repositories showing automation projects
- [ ] Email/Jira/Telegram automation logs
- [ ] Any existing blog posts or documentation about your methods

### 1.3 Create the Pitch Outline
**Draft document structure:**
1. **Hook:** "I want to push your ecosystem to its limits"
2. **Credentials:** Brief showcase of existing AI automation work
3. **Proposal:** 30-day experiment documenting real-world power-user workflows
4. **Deliverables:**
   - Public case study article
   - Screenshot documentation
   - Workflow examples
   - Honest wins + pain points analysis
5. **Value to Perplexity:** Real-world validation + marketing content + power user insights

---

## Phase 2: Execute Using Comet (This SOP)

### 2.1 Use Comet to Build the Plan
**Prompt Comet:** "Create a detailed execution plan for demonstrating AI workflow automation that would convince Perplexity to grant 30-day Pro access. Include specific tasks, screenshots needed, and article outline."

**Output:** Comprehensive plan document

### 2.2 Use Comet to Execute the Plan
**Action sequence:**
1. **Task:** "Navigate to GitHub and create repository for case study documentation"
2. **Task:** "Draft initial proposal document using the pitch outline"
3. **Task:** "Compile existing workflow screenshots into organized folder"
4. **Task:** "Generate article outline for final case study"
5. **Task:** "Create timeline for 30-day experiment phases"

### 2.3 Document Everything
**What to capture:**
- Screenshots of Comet executing each step
- Examples of prompts → plans → executions
- Success metrics (time saved, tasks completed, accuracy rates)
- Pain points encountered
- Workflow improvements discovered

---

## Phase 3: Create the Deliverables

### 3.1 Build the Proposal Package
**Required components:**
- [ ] **Main proposal document** (2-3 pages)
  - Who you are (solo automation developer)
  - What you've already built
  - What you'll document during 30 days
  - Specific deliverables with timeline
  
- [ ] **Portfolio samples** (5-10 examples)
  - Screenshot of AI planning a workflow
  - Screenshot of AI executing that workflow
  - Screenshot of results
  - Brief explanation of each

- [ ] **Article outline** (table of contents)
  - Introduction: The Challenge
  - Methodology: How I Tested
  - Week 1-4: Key Findings
  - Wins: What Worked Brilliantly
  - Pain Points: Where It Struggled
  - Recommendations: For Power Users
  - Conclusion: The Verdict

### 3.2 Create Visual Assets
**Using Comet to generate:**
- [ ] Workflow diagram (AI planning → execution → documentation loop)
- [ ] Before/after comparison screenshots
- [ ] System integration map (all platforms you'll connect)
- [ ] Sample dashboard/metrics visualization

### 3.3 Write the Pitch Email
**Template structure:**
```
Subject: Case Study Proposal: 30-Day Comet Workflow Experiment

Hi [Perplexity Team],

I'm a solo automation developer who uses AI to plan and execute complex workflows across GitHub, Gmail, Jira, and Telegram.

I want to document how far I can push Comet + Perplexity as my primary workflow engine.

**The Proposal:**
- Grant me 30 days of Pro/Comet access
- I'll document everything: successes, failures, workflow patterns
- I'll publish a comprehensive public case study

**What You Get:**
- Real-world power-user validation
- Honest feedback (wins AND pain points)
- Marketing content showing advanced use cases
- Insights from someone building production automation

**What I Bring:**
[2-3 sentence summary + link to portfolio samples]

**Deliverables:**
1. Public article (3000+ words) on [Medium/Dev.to/your blog]
2. Screenshot documentation (50+ examples)
3. Workflow pattern library
4. Video walkthrough (optional)

Timeline: 30 days + 1 week for write-up

This isn't a job application or sponsorship request — it's a documented experiment that benefits both of us.

Interested?

[Your name]
[Links to GitHub, portfolio, etc.]

## Phase 4: Submission & Follow-up

### 4.1 Find the Right Contact
**Research paths:**
- [ ] Perplexity Twitter/X account (DM or @ mention)
- [ ] Perplexity support email
- [ ] Perplexity team members on LinkedIn
- [ ] Perplexity Discord/community channels

### 4.2 Send the Proposal
**Best practices:**
- Keep email under 300 words
- Link to full proposal document (Google Doc, GitHub, Notion)
- Include 2-3 best screenshot examples inline
- Use clear subject line
- Send during business hours (PST timezone)

### 4.3 Follow-up Strategy
If no response:
- **Day 5:** Gentle follow-up email
- **Day 10:** Try different contact method (Twitter if you used email)
- **Day 15:** Post public thread on Twitter showcasing your work, @ mention Perplexity
- **Day 20:** Pivot to creating the case study anyway using free tier + document limitations
